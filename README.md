# Kick

Thunderstore deleted this mod, so here it is for those who know how to manually install it with/or without their terrible, ad-filled UI. 

Disclaimer: I know semiwork is working on a kick feature, but this will suffice until then.

Kick allows hosts (Vanilla or Modded) to kick players with a simple UI. Players **do not** need this mod, you can run a vanilla modded without worry now.
**The kicked player will take ~30-40 seconds to fully disconnect.**

## Usage

- Open the Kick menu using the `F2` key.
- Select a player from the GUI and choose an action.

## UI
![UI](https://i.gyazo.com/07e107678aa0bc03baae16621b9c24e0.png)

## Features

- **Kill Player**: Instantly eliminate a selected player.
- **Force Rolling State**: Continuously forces a player into the "tumble" state, preventing them from recovering.
- **Kick Player**: The entire purpose of this. They may take up 30 seconds to fully disconnect, but once initiating, their client will stop responding.
- **Toggle GUI**: Accessible via `F2`, allowing the host to execute actions easily.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of Kick.
2. Place the `Kick.dll` file into BepInEx's plugins folder.
3. Launch the game and join a multiplayer session as the host.

## Troubleshooting

- If the GUI does not appear, please send me the error output to my Discord @readthisifbad.
- Only the **host** can execute actions; non-hosts will not see the GUI.
